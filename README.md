## 🔍 Overview

The idea was to create a biomedical system that measures 3 values: temperature , pulse and oxygen. When it detects unusual values that could put a person in danger, the system warns the user with special components.

If **O2** is <95 % or **body temperature** is above 38°C or below 36°C or **pulse** < 50 or > 130 , the LED lights up and the buzzer sounds , as the display warns the user with "**CAUTION**" while providing the measured values. If, on the other hand, the user has normal values, the buzzer does not sound , the LED does not light and the display provides the message "**YOU ARE OKAY**".
